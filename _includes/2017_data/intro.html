                    Will I walk again? Speak fluently? Be able to dress by myself? Will I be able to work again? These are some of the questions of stroke survivors. And many do not even survive it. Despite the devastating deficits and huge costs associated with stroke-induced impairments on millions of stroke patients, our society remains largely unaware of the burden of the increasing number of stroke patients.

                    Similarly, there is a severe gap in formal training and knowledge among many clinicians on the essential practices and recent advances in interventions both in the acute and chronic phases of stroke. Little or no resources are directed toward stroke care in many healthcare systems.

                <p>
                    Given the immense neurological and economic impact of stroke, there is an urgent need for more efforts toward fostering a greater understanding of stroke to make more people stroke aware, and there is a critical need to channel more resources toward improving stroke care to make more healthcare systems stroke ready.
